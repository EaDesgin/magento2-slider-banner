## Image Slider module for Magento2
This module allows you to create image sliders or content sliders for Magento2.

The module has been tested with Magento 2.0.x and 2.1.x, however, it should work fine for other Magento 2.x versions as well.


###Why Slider?
Image sliders (or custom content sliders) enables you to grab the attention of your users in an easy way. Moving images are bound to grab attention compared to stationary content.
Also, it allows you to maximize the usage of available screen space. So you are able to display more content to the user within the limitations of the available screen estate.
